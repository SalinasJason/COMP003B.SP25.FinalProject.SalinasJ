My overall purpose for my site is for creating campus events. Anyone to a student, teacher, or someone who wants to help the campus are able to create an event with my website. My website has a create event page were you put the name, description, date, and time of the event. It has a oranizer page were you put the organizer name, email, phone number, and role like student, teacher, or other. A venue page were you put the name, location, owner, and owner phone number. It also has a special guest page were you're able to put there name, email, phone number, and bio. Lastly the event details page links everything together to display the event name, who's organizing it, where it's being hosted, and if there's a special guest. All those pages you are able to create, edit, delete and see details.
